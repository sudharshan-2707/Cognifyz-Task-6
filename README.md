ðŸš€ Task 6: Database Integration and User Authentication

Iâ€™m excited to share my progress on Cognifyz Task-6! This task pushed me to enhance both the functionality and security of the application through robust database integration and user authentication. Here's what I accomplished:

âœ… Database Integration: Successfully integrated a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to efficiently store and retrieve form data, ensuring smooth data handling and retrieval.

âœ… User Authentication: Implemented secure user authentication on the server, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts with confidence.

âœ… API Security: Secured API endpoints by adding robust authorization checks, ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive data and perform protected actions.

Technologies used: 
ðŸ”¹ MySQL
ðŸ”¹ Express.js
ðŸ”¹ JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
ðŸ”¹ Node.js
ðŸ”¹ bcrypt for password hashing
